## Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers based on their demographic and spending behavior.  
The optimal number of clusters is determined using the **Elbow Method** and validated with the **Silhouette Score**.  
Results are visualized using **PCA** for better interpretability.

---
## Features Used for Clustering:

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed

1. Import Libraries â€“ pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, kagglehub.


2. Load Dataset â€“ Used kagglehub to download and load the dataset.


3. Feature Selection â€“ Chose only numerical columns for clustering.


4. Data Scaling â€“ Standardized features with StandardScaler.


5. Elbow Method â€“ Determined the optimal number of clusters (K).


6. K-Means Training â€“ Applied K-Means clustering with chosen K value.


7. Evaluation â€“ Calculated Silhouette Score to measure cluster quality.


8. Visualization â€“ Reduced dimensions to 2D using PCA and plotted clusters.

## ðŸ“Š Results

Optimal K: 5 (based on Elbow Method)

Silhouette Score: ~0.55 (score may slightly vary on different runs)
